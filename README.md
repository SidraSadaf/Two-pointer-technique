# Two-pointer-technique

The 2 pointer technique is mostly applicable in sorted arrays where we try to perform a search in O(N).

Here's an example. 
Given array A sorted in ascending order and an integer K, we need to find i and j, such that a[i]+b[j] is equal to K.

i and j are our pointers, at first step i is pointing to the first element of A, and j points to the last element of A.
